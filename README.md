# Group1-ManagingITProject
Asset & Wealth Services is a small company in Hawthorn. We offer various advice to our customers' investment portfolio including asset management and wealth management.
Currently we are using a paper-based system to record our customers investment portfolio and their relevant investment risk profiles. We find it difficult to gain a better understanding of our customers investment portfolio and, hence, may not be able to give them timely investment advice.
We would like to have an application that can help our investment consultants to analyze our customers investment portfolio and their relevant risk profiles so that they can give timely advice to our customers.
